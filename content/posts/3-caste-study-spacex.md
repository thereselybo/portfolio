# Case study - SpaceX Microsite

## Introduction

This post contains discussion about Project Exam 1 for the first year of Front-end Development, which is completed using skills acquired throughout the year. This includes knowledge within design, web and communication technology, HTML, CSS, project methodology, JavaScript and interaction design.

The result is a microsite for SpaceX contains four pages; Home, Missions, Contact and Mars. These in turn consist of a display of number of humans currently in space, a countdown to the next SpaceX mission, a map of the current location of the International Space Station, a timeline of past SpaceX missions, a contact form, a countdown to Elon Muskâ€™s goal of sending a human to mars, and a report of recent weather on Mars.

## Planning

The following segment contains an overview of the project broken down into milestones, in the shape of a Gantt chart. This chart shows the order in which I planned to execute the tasks as well as the amount of time I planned to spend on each task.

## Research

Doing the research I found that SpaceX is a corporation which focuses on reasonable space transportation. They work to revolutionize space technology, and their ultimate goal is to enable people to live on other planets.

Given that the assignment brief stated that the microsite should contribute to raise awareness about space program activity, I came to think that these large organisations already are quite enlightened about the field in question. With this in mind I figured I would aim the content towards an audience who might not already have too much expertise in this field and landed on targeting students and youngsters in particular, and in general anyone curious about the subject.

It is quite a wide target audience, but the main objective is to make the information engaging and interesting, we would not want it being too technical and formal. Anyone who would want to immerse themselves further into the topic will be easily guided to the SpaceX website.

## Conclusion

I have had a lot of fun during these past few weeks. As per usual I have taken the opportunity to try and learn something new, and boy did I ever. And although I am sure I could have spent the time somewhat differently, I would have loved to have another week or so to explore different approaches to certain aspects of the project. I may not have followed my planned schedule to a tee but I am not sure I could have planned it much differently, so overall I think that part went well.

There are still certain elements which I am not completely satisfied with, such as the fixed spaceship background, which is something I would like to play more with and learn more about, as for other ways to solve it and implement it. In retrospect I also think I could have added a little more zing to the whole timeline, but I am relatively pleased with it. As I mentioned several times I intended to use the time I might have left to go back and experiment more with certain features, but it gets to a certain point where one has to decide the product is good enough.

All in all I do think the final result of the project turned out pretty cool, and in my opinion it would fulfill its task as a microsite and engage its target audience. I think I managed my goal of creating a playful and engaging place to learn some fun facts and experience cool features, and easily be able to navigate to the official SpaceX website for further information for those who are particularly interested.

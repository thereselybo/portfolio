# Case study - Community Science Museum

## Introduction

This post will tell in detail how I went through the process and the different stages in particular of creating a mobile responsive website for the fictional “Community Science Museum”.

The project is completed using competence acquired during the first semester of my Front-end Development studies. These skills consist of those within design, web and communications technology, HTML, CSS and project methodology.

In later time the project has been updated and improved to include skills such as IxD and JavaScript.

## Planning

To kick off this semester project I started by making an analysis of the assignment. I went through all the provided content and made notes. From there I was able to write a list of all the upcoming tasks and make a network diagram. I concluded there was a natural flow to the path of the critical tasks, and really without any particular floating tasks to consider.

I based the timeline on the recommended process from the project description and worked from that, filling in the gaps as suitable. The time frame for these remaining tasks I was able to decide on the basis of previous assignments, from which I added some margin of error as this is quite a large project, making it natural to spend more time on each task.

### Analysis and research

Here are a few of my findings during my analysis of the assignment:

- The target audience is school children (age 7-15) and families with young children
- The desired product is an informative and appealing website, encouraging viewers to come visit the museum
- Should be responsive

I continued to reflect a bit on how to hit the target audience, what to include, what message I wanted to convey and so forth, before moving on to doing research on the competition.

To understand how similar businesses have gone about making their websites, I did a Google search as per usual, searching for terms as the following:

- Science museum
- Science center
- Interactive science
- Kids+science
- Kids+learning

One of the first things that occurred to me when browsing through similar websites was how very formal and informative the ambience typically was. These websites were mostly made to be informative and seemed a bit dull for this purpose, and that was something I quickly realized would be wrong for mine. Although the client is a museum, and thus possibly expected to convey a somewhat formal mood, I obviously want it to appeal to the target audience, which in this case is young children and their families.

Other websites on the other hand seemed too much and too complex, with poor styling, really with quite bad design and in general poor user experience. Several had chaotic layouts and designs, gritty JPG images and icons, and some clearly was not made with any consideration to an appropriate color palette. So this was something I definitely wanted to steer clear of.

It was important to me to make the website in such a manner that would keep the target audience interested and intrigued as well as being informative. With this in mind I made a mental note on that the product should be appropriately colorful, in addition to using a decorative font for my headings, and then keep the rest of the content neat and clean to balance it all.

### Wireframes and prototype

For this assignment I decided to experiment with Adobe XD as I was quite new to it, and make digital wireframes instead of drawing the sketches out on paper, as to take the opportunity to learn something new. Moving forward I used Illustrator to make a complete prototype. The following content is part of the original result.

## Conclusion

I am really a figure-it-out-as-I-go kind of gal, and it did feel a bit unusual to plan every step down to the tee. However I found making the Gantt chart very helpful for the progress of the project. I am very happy with how it turned out in terms of distribution of tasks and time, if we disregard the fact that I slightly underestimated the complexity of certain choices. I actually found myself finishing up the HTML in just one day, giving me a couple more days of experimenting with different solutions with CSS such as the hamburger menu and a pop-up contact form (an idea I eventually discarded). However, parts of my design turned out to be a bit more vast than I predicted, and so I ended up spending a lot of time here. That being said, this part of the project turned out to be the one I enjoyed the most, as I also learned a lot from it.

I was, moreover, reminded that things don’t always go according to plan. Although making an effort to sticking to the plan often is key, sometimes one should just go with the flow and see what happens/comes out of it. One’s initial idea might not turn out just as one envisioned, and that just might be alright. Perhaps the end result turns out better after experimenting. I for one believe that was the case for this project of mine.
